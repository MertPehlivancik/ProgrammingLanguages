# Calories
## Steps
- Download a file calories.csv (It is an CSV file with ";" separating the columns.)
- Replace the ";" character with a ":" character in the calories.csv.
- Delete the quotes (") from the file.
- Print the second column of the file containing the measurements information.
- Replace the lowercase letters with the uppercase letters in the first (and only in first!) column of the calories.csv file (Hint: combine "cut", "tr" and "paste" commands in that order)
- Print the first column into the file "names_original". Replace the whitespace (" ") with the "_" character (create a new file "names_modified"). Compare the files using "diff" command.
- Sort the file by weight from the heaviest to the least heavy. Keep the header (first line) in the original place.
- Sort the file by the amount of carbohydrates, fat and protein (in that order) increasingly. Again, keep the header.
- Switch the order of the first two columns.
- Print only the permission rights from the ls -l output.
- Print only the filenames and their size using the outputs of "ls" and "ls -l" commands.
- Print the usernames from the /etc/passwords, four users per line (separated by comma).
